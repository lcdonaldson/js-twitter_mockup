# twitter-mockup

This was a project done at Rockit Bootcamp that helped us incorporate front end technologies to pipe things
together with a gulp file. It is essentially a mock version of twitter minus the login and a real back end. We had to
use JSON as a database and persist to it through AJAX. All and all it was very cool but at the time, quite over my head.
I will be revisiting this project in the future and I will recreate a different version of this. However I want this to 
stand as a record so I can see where I have gotten better as a developer.
